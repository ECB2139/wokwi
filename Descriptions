Basic Heater Control System Design



To implement a basic heater control system, the following sensors and components are required:

Temperature Sensor: To monitor ambient or object temperature. Examples:

  DHT11/DHT22 (Digital)
  LM35/NTC Thermistor (Analog)
  DS18B20 (Digital, OneWire)

Heater (Simulated via digital output): An LED  for testing purposes.

Recommended Communication Protocol

UART (Serial Communication) is recommended for initial prototyping and debugging:

Justification:

 Simple and well-supported on Arduino and ESP platforms.
 Requires minimal setup.
 Ideal for logging temperature and heater status to a serial monitor.

Optional for Bonus Features:

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) for wireless state broadcasting.


 State Machine

The system uses a temperature-based state machine with the following states:

Idle: System initialized, waiting for temperature change.
Heating: Heater is ON, raising temperature.
Stabilizing: Heater toggled to maintain target.
Target Reached: Desired temperature maintained.
Overheat: Temperature exceeded safe limit.
